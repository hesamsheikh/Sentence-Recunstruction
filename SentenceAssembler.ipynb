It's important to know the loss function doesn't directly represent how good the model performs on the custom defined score. The bidirectional LSTM achieves Train Accuracy: 0.9357 and Test Accuracy: 0.8791, but there is a substantial gap between the  **47.8%** score. Testing out other loss functions such as `sequence_loss` or designing a custom loss function could yield better results.\n",

They use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data, irrespective of their positions within the sequence. However, their complexity, potential overfitting and longer training time could make them subpar for our task.\n",
