The purpose of the project is to take in input a scrumbled sentence and reconstruct it in its correct order.

For instance, given the sequence of words

```>>> paper dried dirt has easier to be removed after   ```

the model should be able to reconstruct the following sentence

```>>> dirt is easier to remove after paper has dried```

You cannot use pretrained model.

A detailed description of the task, the dataset and the metric to use for evaluating the project are given in the attached notebook.
